# Third-Party Software Notices

This repository (`curtiskrygier/a2ui-catalogue`) derives atoms from open-source
component libraries. No vendor source files are stored here — adaptations are
documented in `vendors/<vendor>/MANIFEST.md` and the rendering logic is
recompiled from scratch into `renderers/web_article.py`. Each atom carries a
`source` field in `atoms/schema.yaml` identifying its origin.

## UIverse.io community

- **Project:** UIverse — Open-source UI elements
- **Website:** https://uiverse.io
- **License:** MIT License
- **Copyright:** Copyright (c) UIverse contributors

**Adapted atoms (31):**
`stat_card`, `progress_bar`, `badge_group`, `sparkline`, `heatmap`,
`donut_stat`, `css_modal`, `alert_banner`, `toast_notification`,
`loading_skeleton`, `spinner`, `status_pill`, `rating_stars`,
`progress_circle`, `toggle_switch`, `flip_card`, `image_hotspots`,
`css_dropdown_menu`, `star_rating_input`, `segmented_control`,
`zoomable_image`, `custom_checkbox_group`, `css_slide_panel`,
`star_rating_display`, `avatar_group`, `social_proof_banner`,
`cli_command`, `copy_code_button`, `social_share_bar`,
`reaction_group`, `follow_button`

**Modifications made:**
Visual CSS patterns from the UIverse community library were translated into
A2UI's field-based schema. Rendering logic is rewritten in Python
(`renderers/web_article.py`) — no original CSS is distributed. The visual
intent (colours, layout proportions, animation timing) is preserved.
All design credit belongs to the respective UIverse community contributors.

See `vendors/uiverse/MANIFEST.md` for the full pattern-to-atom mapping.

## Flowbite

- **Project:** Flowbite — Tailwind CSS Component Library
- **Website:** https://flowbite.com
- **Repository:** https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite
- **License:** MIT License
- **Copyright:** Copyright (c) 2021 Bergside Inc.

**Adapted atoms (16):**
`http_request_block`, `prerequisite_checklist`, `keyboard_shortcut`,
`version_badge`, `experimental_banner`, `key_takeaways`,
`learning_objectives`, `release_notes`, `resources_list`,
`difficulty_badge`, `checklist_interactive`, `time_estimate`,
`newsletter_cta`, `author_bio_card`, `share_quote`, `follow_cta`

**Modifications made:**
Content and documentation component patterns from Flowbite were adapted into
A2UI's surface-agnostic field schema. Tailwind CSS class-driven styling and
Alpine.js interactivity are replaced by self-contained HTML/CSS rendered by
`web_article.py`. No Flowbite source files are distributed.

See `vendors/flowbite/MANIFEST.md` for the full component-to-atom mapping.

## shadcn/ui

- **Project:** shadcn/ui — Beautifully designed components
- **Website:** https://ui.shadcn.com
- **Repository:** https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui
- **License:** MIT License
- **Copyright:** Copyright (c) 2023 shadcn

**Adapted atoms (12):**
`file_tree`, `tabbed_code`, `api_param_table`, `deprecation_notice`,
`json_tree_viewer`, `summary_box`, `changelog_entry`, `sidebar_note`,
`caution_block`, `glossary_inline`, `progress_checkpoint`,
`series_overview_card`

**Modifications made:**
Developer-documentation component patterns from shadcn/ui were translated
from Radix UI / Tailwind CSS React components into A2UI's field schema.
Rendering is recompiled into `web_article.py` with no dependency on React,
Radix UI, or Tailwind. No shadcn/ui source files are distributed.

See `vendors/shadcn/MANIFEST.md` for the full component-to-atom mapping.

## OpenUI / Thesys

- **Project:** OpenUI — The Open Standard for Generative UI
- **Repository:** https://github.com/thesysdev/openui
- **License:** MIT License
- **Copyright:** Copyright (c) 2024 Thesys, Inc.

**Adapted atoms (10):**
`form`, `form_input`, `form_select`, `form_radio_group`,
`form_checkbox_group`, `form_switch_group`, `form_slider`,
`form_date_picker`, `modal`, `follow_up_chips`

**Modifications made:**
Component prop schemas are derived from Zod definitions in OpenUI's standard
library (`packages/react-ui/src/genui-lib`, each component's `schema.ts`).
The following adaptations were made:

- React/Zod prop schemas re-expressed as A2UI YAML field definitions
- Field names converted from camelCase to snake_case per A2UI conventions
- `reactive()` wrapper fields (live state bindings) expressed as static
  default values
- Validation rule arrays (`rulesSchema`) preserved as `rules: string[]`
  accepting `"required"`, `"email"`, `"minLength:N"`, `"maxLength:N"`
- `FollowUpBlock` / `FollowUpItem` merged into a single `follow_up_chips`
  atom with `items: string[]`, matching A2UI's flat-field convention
- Rendering recompiled into `web_article.py` — no React, Zod, or runtime
  dependency on the original library

See `vendors/openui/MANIFEST.md` for the full component-to-atom mapping.

## ExtendLabs UI

- **Project:** ExtendLabs UI
- **Repository:** https://github.com/extend-labs/ui
- **License:** MIT License
- **Copyright:** Copyright (c) 2024 extendui

**Ported components (11 Lit Web Components):**
`ext-button`, `ext-badge`, `ext-alert`, `ext-card`, `ext-checkbox`,
`ext-input`, `ext-label`, `ext-switch`, `ext-textarea`, `ext-table`,
`ext-tabs`

Located in `components/extendlabs/`. These are derived works — React
components ported to Lit Web Components for the A2UI stateless canvas
framework. Each file carries an in-source attribution comment.

**Modifications made:**
- React state (`useState`, `useReducer`) removed; all visual states are
  prop-driven
- Radix UI, CVA, and lucide-react dependencies replaced with Lit/CSS
  equivalents
- `onClick`/`onChange`/`onBlur` handlers replaced with the A2UI action
  protocol (`a2ui-action` CustomEvent dispatch)
- Tailwind CSS keyframe animations re-implemented as shadow DOM `@keyframes`
  CSS
- Compound React components (e.g. `Card`/`CardHeader`/`CardContent`) collapsed
  into single Lit elements with prop-driven slots

Note: no catalogue atoms were adapted from ExtendLabs UI — these are stage
components, not vocabulary atoms. `inline_alert` is a candidate for future
catalogue adaptation.

See `vendors/extendlabs-ui/MANIFEST.md` for the full component review and
`scripts/vendor_manifests/extendlabs-ui.yaml` for the port mapping.
